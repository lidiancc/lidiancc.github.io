<p> The first animal I created was a combination of a dog, a penguin and a duck. I came up with it because those three animals are some of my favorites. This animal has the ability to fly. For the second animal I created, I decided to combine a cat, a swan and a flamingo. I thought combining these animals would make a worthy opponent for my first animal because they would be opposites.  This animal can also fly. For all of these animals, I erased the background and some parts of their bodies to combine them together.</p>
