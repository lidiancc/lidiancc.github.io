<h2> This is my Kaleidoscope</h2>

<img src= "LCreflections1 copy.jpg" alt= "Kaleidoscope" length= "300" width="300">
	
<p> The original image I used was chicken. I chose it because it’s my favorite food. I used hue and saturation to change the color until I was fully satisfied with it. I also kept using the horizontal and vertical tools to make it seem more realistic, especially when it came to showing the pattern on every corner of the frame. It didn’t take much time for me to finish because I didn’t make the pictures too small.
