<h2> This is my mandala</h2>

<img src= "LC.Mandala1.jpg" alt= "Mandalas" length= "300" width="300">
<p> I chose a flower as my starting shape because I thought it would look good. The colors I chose are red, turquoise, purple and green. I slightly changed the hues of each color until I liked the way the colors looked. Everytime I added a new layer, I turned them to the right and slightly decreased the size. I also made sure to keep an even distance between all the shapes.
