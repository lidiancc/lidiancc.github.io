<img src= "LCbeastsfinal.png" alt= "Beasts" width="400">
<p> The photo I chose is a photo I had taken a while ago. It was of decent quality, so I thought it would be easy to recreate.
I started with the pen tool to outline the shapes,then I used the direct selection tool to make the shapes more accurate. 
To fill in shapes, like the mask, I used the brush tool. The text I decided to include for the background is my initials.</p>
