<h2> This is my Pop Art</h2>

<p> I chose this portrait, instead of the other two because I really like the colors I used and it's my favorite style. I chose Zendaya, an actress, because I think she is very talented. I chose the color red and light pink because I think they have a nice contrast. I used the threshold tool and the color picker to choose both colors. </p>
