<p>For this assignment, I chose a photo of myself to trace. I used the pen tool with no fill color
to trace every shape. Then, I used the direct selection tool to make each line more close to the original photo. 
This was kind of difficult for me because I am not very good at drawing and my photo was kind of hard to see.</p>
