<p style = "color:purple";>	
The Utah monolith was a three-meter-tall (9.8 ft) metal pillar that stood in a red sandstone slot canyon in northern San Juan County in the U.S. state of Utah. Made of metal sheets riveted into a triangular prism, it was unlawfully placed on public land between July and October 2016, and stood unnoticed for more than four years until its discovery and removal in late 2020. The identity of its makers, and their objectives, are unknown. Following its discovery, numerous similar metal columns, many of which were built by local artists as deliberate imitations, were erected in other places throughout the world. This photograph shows the Utah monolith at its original location.d]</p>
